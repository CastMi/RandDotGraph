============

RandDotGraph is a program to generate random graphs in the graph description
language DOT.

--------------
Brief introduction
--------------

The goal of this program is not only to give the possibility to create a graph
easily, but also to release highly reusable code and therefore to keep an eye
on security, ease of debug, ease of use and portability.
I am working on this during my spare time.
If you find this code useful or if you want to give me any suggestion or
whatever, feel free to contact me: It will encourage me.
Please, let me know when you find any problems.

----------------------
Features
----------------------

The code is c99 compliant.
Support for:

        Directed graph
        Undirected graph
        Graph without self loop

----------------------
Command Line Arguments
----------------------

Example:  ./RandDotGraph -v VerticesNumber [-t Type] [-e EdgesNumber] [-s]

VerticesNumber
        (required) Specifies the number of vertices for the graph that we are
                   going to create.

Type
        (optional) Specifies the type of the edges for the graph.
                   It can be directed or undirected.

EdgesNumber
        (optional) Specifies the number of edges for the graph that we are going
                   to create.
                   If EdgesNumber is missed, 0 is used.

-s
        (optional) The graph that we are going to create will be without
                   selfloop.

The order of the command line arguments is not important.

----------------------
Output
----------------------

The output will be in the file named "RandomGraph.dot".

----------------------
Argument Checking
----------------------

Since a graph with no vertices is still part of the language, a number of
vertices equal to zero is still allowable.
Therefore the following checks are performed:

        EdgesNumber >= 0
        VerticesNumber >= 0
        Check whether the parameters are correct with respect to the type of
        the graph

----------------------
Debug & Testing
----------------------

If you want to edit/expand/improve this code, there are already some useful
assert to help in the debugging phase.
This is the command to active them:

        make debug

The output filename is "debug.out".

----------------------
Release
----------------------

This is the command to simply use RandDotGraph:

        make release

The output filename is "release.out".
